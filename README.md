# Abstract
Kalman filter-based tracking-by-detection (KFTBD) trackers are effective methods for solving multi-person tracking tasks. However, in crowd circumstances, noisy detection results (bounding boxes with low-confidence scores) can cause ID switch and tracking failure of trackers since these trackers utilize the detectorâ€™s output directly. In this paper, to solve the problem, we suggest a novel tracker
called ConfTrack based on a KFTBD tracker. Compared with conventional KFTBD trackers, ConfTrack consists of novel algorithms, including low-confidence object penalization and cascading algorithms for effectively dealing with noisy detector outputs. ConfTrack is tested on diverse domains of datasets such as the MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack, and HiEve datasets. ConfTrack has proved its robustness
in crowd circumstances by achieving the highest score at HOTA and IDF1 metrics in the MOT20 dataset.
